## User alias
$UserAlias = "Username"


## At first we need to get all folders from mailbox that is interested for us
$folders = Get-Mailbox $UserAlias | Get-MailboxFolderStatistics | sort name | select FolderPath

## Now it's time to get permissions granted for each and every folder one by one: 
Foreach ( $folder in $Folders) {$t = $UserAlias + ":" + $folder.folderpath ; $t ; $data += Get-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity ($t).replace("/","\") }

## Here we just filtering to only a user name that is interested for us, In this case I was need to check to which folders in mailbox G3276 have access user "Conzelmann"
$data | ?{$_.user -ilike "*Conzelmann*"} | ft -a
